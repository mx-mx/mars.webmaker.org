Here are the values (all REQUIRED unless noted otherwise):

uid = Unique Identifier should be locally unique.
name = The name of your badge. Example "Badge-It Gadget Lite Badgee" (max 128 characters)
image = The filename of the image. Example "badge-it-gadget-lite.png". This image should be in your $badge_images_dir. (Badge must be a .png) 
evidence_url =  Relative URL (In this example we are using the criteria URL as evidence URL... Ideally, a unique page that represents the actual work of the user). 
                It should be on the same server as Badge-It Gadget Lite. If you keep the directory structure as is, you can just change the .html file name in the example.
expires = OPTIONAL. Date when the badge expires. If omitted, the badge never expires. Format: YYYY-MM-DD

Notice there is a number and an array of values for each badge. The example below has five badges.
